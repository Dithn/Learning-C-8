# Structure and code conventions

The source code is located in the *src* folder.

For each chapter, there is a subfolder here with the name chapter_*number* (e.g. chapter_02, chapter_03, etc.)
For each different topic in a chapter, there is a different project. For instance:

* chapter_07\chapter_07_01 - Delegates and Events
* chapter_07\chapter_07_02 - Tuples
* chapter_07\chapter_07_03 - Pattern matching
* chapter_07\chapter_07_04 - Regular expressions

The solution file *learning_charp8.sln* contains all these projects together. The projects are .NET Core console apps and target .NET Core 3.0.
